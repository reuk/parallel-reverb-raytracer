parallel raytrace
=================

A raytracer for impulse responses (for reverb), influenced by raster graphics
lighting techniques.
Uses OpenCL for IMMENSE SPEED.

build notes
-----------

Only tested on Mac OS X Yosemite.

Mostly C++11, but uses generic lambda parameters from C++1y, so you'll need a
fairly modern C++ compiler to build.
You'll also need CMake to build.

You need the following libraries installed in a standard location (probably
/usr/local/lib, /usr/local/include) so that CMake can find and link them:
* FFTW (fftw3f)
* Assimp
* Libsndfile
* rapidjson (although this is header-only)

If you're on a Mac with homebrew you can set-up and build with:

```bash
# install cmake and libraries with simple builds
brew install cmake fftw libsndfile

# rapidjson is a bit special because it doesn't have a stable branch
brew install --HEAD homebrew/head-only/rapidjson

# assimp doesn't build a static library by default, so you need to edit the
# homebrew forumula
brew edit assimp

# then change the install function to
#
# def install
#     args = std_cmake_args
#     args << "-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF"
#     system "cmake", ".", *args
#     system "make", "install"
# end
#
# save, and exit the editor

# now install your shiny custom assimp
brew install assimp --build-from-source

cd <path to repo>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# optional
make install
```

Once these libraries all have CMake builds of their own I (might) add git
submodules for them.

On Mac OS X the OpenCL framework is used.
Obviously this isn't something that Linuxes have, so at some point I'll try
making the build a bit more platform agnostic, to see if it will run on Linux
as well.

Want docs?
First you'll need to `brew install doxygen`.
Then basic but pretty docs can be generated by running `doxygen` in the root
dir of the project.

system requirements
-------------------

Should run on any recent Mac running Mavericks or newer with a discrete
graphics card.
Might also work on systems with integrated graphics, but this has not been
tested.

getting started
---------------

A pretty version of the program's man page can be found in the `cmd` folder
(named parallel_raytrace.1.md.pdf).
This should serve as a quick introduction, and get you started running the
software.

Example models and configuration files are found in the `assets` folder,
and some example runs are found in `demo/gen.sh`.
If you have a local copy of the repository, and you've run `make install` from
your build folder, you should be able to `cd` into the `demo` folder and then
run `./gen.sh` to generate a whole bunch of sample impulse-responses.

license
-------

This program depends on FFTW3, which is licensed under the GNU GPL.
This software is therefore also licensed under the GNU GPL.

repo structure
--------------

* *assets* - example models and config files
